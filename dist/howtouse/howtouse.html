</div>

<div>
The following controls are available to customize your report to provide different repayment scenarios:
</div>
	
<dl>	
	<dt>Extra Payment</dt>
	<dd> - Enter the total amount to be applied above the accounts' minimum payments. The algorithm selected will apply the extra to the correct account </dd>

</dl>

<div>
No information will be displayed until you press the Generate Report button.  If the button is pressed with the defaults selected, no additional money will be applied towards repayment, and the report will show the Highest APR First algorithm.  To show anything further, type the amount of money to be paid over the minimum payments, if any, into the Extra Payment field, select the preferred algorithm from the dropdown Algorithm menu, and then press Generate Report.
